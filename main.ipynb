      " 'response': AIMessage(content='### **Liberty of the Person under the Constitution of Singapore**\\n\\n- **Legal Basis**: The liberty of the person in Singapore is primarily governed by Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. This article states:\\n  1. **Clause 9(1)**: \"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.\"\\n  2. **Clause 9(2)**: \"Where a complaint is made to the General Division of the High Court or any Judge sitting in the General Division of the High Court that a person is being unlawfully detained, the General Division of the High Court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the General Division of the High Court and release him.\"\\n\\n- **Explanation**: Article 9(1) establishes the fundamental right to personal liberty, ensuring that no individual can be deprived of their liberty without legal justification. This clause emphasizes the rule of law, meaning that any deprivation of liberty must be in accordance with established laws and procedures. Article 9(2) provides a mechanism for individuals to challenge unlawful detention, allowing them to seek redress through the courts. This judicial oversight is crucial in protecting individuals from arbitrary detention by the state.\\n\\n  Additionally, the retrieved context mentions that clauses (3) and (4) of Article 9 do not apply to \"an enemy alien or to any person arrested for contempt of Parliament pursuant to a warrant issued under the hand of the Speaker.\" This indicates that certain exceptions exist where the protections under Article 9 may not apply, particularly in cases involving national security or parliamentary procedures.\\n\\n- **Conclusion**: The Constitution of Singapore guarantees the liberty of the person as a fundamental right, with specific provisions to prevent unlawful detention. While there are exceptions for certain categories of individuals, the overarching principle remains that any deprivation of liberty must be lawful and subject to judicial review. This framework is essential for upholding individual rights and maintaining the rule of law in Singapore.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 412, 'prompt_tokens': 10938, 'total_tokens': 11350, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3267753c5d', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-e92d8887-253a-4a17-b977-7e8300bf1465-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 10938, 'output_tokens': 412, 'total_tokens': 11350, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}),\n",

      "### **Liberty of the Person under the Constitution of Singapore**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Legal Basis**: The liberty of the person in Singapore is primarily governed by Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. This article states:\n",
      "  1. **Clause 9(1)**: \"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.\"\n",
      "  2. **Clause 9(2)**: \"Where a complaint is made to the General Division of the High Court or any Judge sitting in the General Division of the High Court that a person is being unlawfully detained, the General Division of the High Court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the General Division of the High Court and release him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Explanation**: Article 9(1) establishes the fundamental right to personal liberty, ensuring that no individual can be deprived of their liberty without legal justification. This clause emphasizes the rule of law, meaning that any deprivation of liberty must be in accordance with established laws and procedures. Article 9(2) provides a mechanism for individuals to challenge unlawful detention, allowing them to seek redress through the courts. This judicial oversight is crucial in protecting individuals from arbitrary detention by the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Additionally, the retrieved context mentions that clauses (3) and (4) of Article 9 do not apply to \"an enemy alien or to any person arrested for contempt of Parliament pursuant to a warrant issued under the hand of the Speaker.\" This indicates that certain exceptions exist where the protections under Article 9 may not apply, particularly in cases involving national security or parliamentary procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Conclusion**: The Constitution of Singapore guarantees the liberty of the person as a fundamental right, with specific provisions to prevent unlawful detention. While there are exceptions for certain categories of individuals, the overarching principle remains that any deprivation of liberty must be lawful and subject to judicial review. This framework is essential for upholding individual rights and maintaining the rule of law in Singapore.\n"
